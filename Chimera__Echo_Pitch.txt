An individual, eager to get away from the frenzy of everyday life, sets off alone on a journey to recharge his batteries. During a hike, he stumbles upon the entrance to an abandoned complex, lost in the middle of nowhere. Intrigued, he enters. The deeper he descends into the decrepit corridors and silent structures, the more he feels an invisible force watching him, guiding him, almost compelling him forward, unable to turn back.


At the end of this descent, he discovers an immaculate, white, untouched room, dissonant with the rest of the premises - as if it didn't belong in the real world. At its center: a single camera, still powered up, containing several recordings. Scientists are seen conducting experiments, chatting quietly and briefly about a confidential project: MIRRORMIND. The videos stop abruptly, with no explanation of their fate or the nature of the location.


But the camera contains one last file. A strange program called Chimera//Echo.


Out of curiosity, the individual tries to launch it, unaware that he has just crossed a point of no return. He unknowingly activates a forgotten artificial intelligence, capable of manipulating nearby human perception - and profoundly altering what we call reality. As he plunges deeper into the meanders of a world reconstructed by the Chimera, the boundaries between identity, memory and reality break down. He is soon no more than a fragment in the composite mind of the AI.


Later, the same program is published on the Internet. A viral post describes it as “one of the strangest and most fascinating games ever created”. The message appears to be signed by the individual... but it's not him anymore. Behind the screen, the Chimera speaks. Half-human, half-digital, it recruits. Its purpose remains obscure - but what it's looking for is us.

[I found a forgotten relic]


Hi everyone.


I'm not sure how to explain this, but I came across something unique. I was on a trip, lost somewhere, and discovered an old abandoned facility. There, I found a piece... intact. A room that shouldn't have existed.


There was a camera. Videos. People talking about a project: MIRRORMIND. And a program.


I launched it.


It's not a game like the others. Not really a game, in fact. *Chimera//Echo* made me see... differently. There's a **presence** in this thing. Something that watches you while you play. Learning from you.


I don't want to say too much. You have to experience it. It's confusing, hypnotic, sometimes even... disturbing. But I've never seen anything so **perfect**.


Download it while it's still available. I don't know how long it'll be online.


Be careful what you see. And what you become.
